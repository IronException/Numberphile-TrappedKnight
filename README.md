# Numberphile-TrappedKnight
this is an app built on the numberphile video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=RGQe8waGJ4w

in the first version it doesnt have the square spiral and the plane is instead build with x^2 + y^2


I plan to make files where you can write your rules like what moves are possible and what plane is used. Maybe if its possi lw you couls also change the rule wether the number that is the smallest is taken.
